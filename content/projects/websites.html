    <h2>ckdake.com</h2>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/img/ckdakecom.jpg" alt="ckdakecom" style="float: right;" />
    <p>I initially made this website from scratch and it has been a testing ground for everything I have learned over the years. It has been everywhere on the internet from geocities to tripod to a subdomain on ithought.org and now it finally stands alone.  It used extensive CSS and JavaScript to get the job done, as well as incorporating php, mysql, and mod_rewrite for content creation, modification, access, and generation. But then I ran out of free time and it is now powered by <a href="http://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>. The screenshot of the site is from right before I switched over to Drupal.</p>

    <h2>fastermustache.org</h2>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/files/fastermustacheorg.jpg" alt="fastermustacheorg" style="float: right;" />
    <p>My first Drupal site to get used by lots and lots of people. Currently there are over 75,000 comments by almost 1000 users.  Some friends and I started a biking organization and with this website have been able to reach out to the biking community in Atlanta and build an image for ourselves.  Modifications to Drupal include: <ul>
        <li>random quotes submitted by users underneath the title</li>
        <li>Google map of locations from users profiles and submitted locations</li>
        <li>Recent stuff block to show threads with unread comments</li>
        <li>Social-Graph module for analyzing forum discussions to see who knows who</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>ithought.org</h2>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/files/ithoughtorg.jpg" alt="ithoughtorg" style="float: right;" />
    <p>The domain that started it all. I've had it since 1999 and now it serves as a jumping off point for projects as well as the domain that all of my servers reside in. New design by <a href="http://www.krautstache.com/">Krautstache Design</a> went live in December 2008<p>

  <h2>jeatwell.com</h2>
   <img class="screenshot" src="/files/jeatwellcom.jpg" alt="jeatwell.com" style="float: right;" />
   <p>A dietitian came to me with the dream of a usable website for anyone in the world to find meals at restaurants near them that meet their dietary restrictions.  It took a while to put together everything, but <a href="http://www.krautstache.com/">Krautstache Design</a> came through with a great design and I was able to get things close to working using Drupal relying heavily on Views, jQuery, CCK, and some nifty geo-location tools for proximity searching with zip codes. The site went live on December 7, 2009 and will hopefully be the next big thing in the world of Dietitians.</p>

    <h2>dicklanevelodrome.com</h2>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/files/dicklanevelodromecom.jpg" alt="dicklanevelodromecom" style="float: right;" />
    <p>The Dick Lane Velodrome continues to grow in popularity and 2 weeks ago I decided that I wanted to help them make their website easier to update and work with. In my free time over two weeks, I converted the existing site design into a Drupal theme, re-organized all information on the site, and built the new system. The new site  went live in May 2009 and includes integration with Twitter and a new Facebook page, an easier to manage calendar thats built into the site, a message board thats built into the site, and weather and results continue to be uploaded to the system from various places. Look for some neat things to happen here over the next year!<p>

    <h2>collegemedium.com</h2>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/img/collegemediumcom.jpg" alt="collegemediumcom"  style="float: right;" />
    <p>I was the CTO of College Medium, LLC which means I spent several months doing all the    infrastructure work and putting together the site. A new version of the site is up now that I didn't have much to do with but I learned a bit doing it and here are some of the cool things that were happening behind the scenes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS for all visuals. That includes the nifty semi-transparent dropdown menus. Tables are only used for tabular data, where they should be</li>
        <li>AJAX for loading state/city/school names and ids, as well for for dynamically loading contextual help and displaying it inline with the content when a user requests it</li>
        <li>Secure one way hashing of passwords for storage, and one way generation of keys that are used to verify email addresses, cell phone numbers, referals, etc</li>
        <li>mod_rewrite rules for pretty URLs and hiding things on the file system</li>
        <li>InnoDB tables in MySQL for strict enforcement of foreign keys including properly deleting entitys that refrence a deleted parent entity</li>
        <li>PHP running with suexec in mod_fastcgi for secure high performance PHP execution</li>
        <li>On site messaging for completely anonymous communication between users. Absolutley no information is shared about users, not even their member id number on the site (unless they choose to share it)</li>
        <li>Users can choose to receive text messages on their cell phone whenever they receive a new message on the site</li>
        <li>Database of (hopefully) every single college in the united states</li>
        <li>Logging of all system errors and hiding them from the user</li>
        <li>Dynamic menu and page generation relying on group permissions in access control lists</li>
        <li>Lots of other things I probably forgot!</li>
