<h3>Audio</h3>
Here are some sounds I've made. Please don't use it for anything other than your personal enjoyment without asking me first. Thanks!

<a href="/files/the_lair_-_yesterday.mp3">The Lair - Yesterday</a>(7.3M mp3) - Some of my roommates decided to remake a song that I recorded during high school with "Mile Zero".  Vocals and Bass guitar are me and Guitars are Frank and Ben. This was done in Apple's Garageband a few days after it was released.<br /><br />
<a href="/files/the_lair_-_ilife.mp3">The Lair - iLife</a>(2.5M mp3) - This is the first try at using GarageBand. Ben on vocals, me on Bass, Frank and Ben on Guitar. Ben made up the lyrics on the go and I think they turned out alright.<br /><br />
These are some songs I made just playing around with GarageBand:
                <ul>
                        <li><a href="/files/ckdake_-_mello_piano.mp3">Mello Piano</a>(6.4M mp3) - Probably my favorite thing so far.</li>
                        <li><a href="/files/ckdake_-_randomness.mp3">Randomness</a>(2.6M mp3) - Random beats that fit together nicely.</li>
                </ul>
<br /><br />
<a href="/files/chris_kelly_-_waking_on_a_winter_morning.mp3">Chris Kelly - Waking On a Winter Morning</a>(4.1M mp3) - My final project for Music Theory I.  Composed and Performed by me using <a href="http://www.rosegardenmusic.com/">Rhythmbox</a>.
