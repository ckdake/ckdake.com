# Instigator. Problem Solver.

## Profile

I’m a technical polyglot with demonstrated knowledge in a wide range of technologies, with leadership experience and a track record of successful teams and projects. I’ve built full-stack web applications, automated a datacenter or two, and want to continue to solve bigger problems by leading a growing team of experts. I’ve worked remotely and with flexible hours, but like the structure and balance and typical hours that an office provide, and love calling Atlanta home. I’ve orchestrated a 24 hour bicycle race (and built its RFID tracking system), and I am well suited to play devils advocate or convince anyone to do anything from jumping out of a plane to using a particular project management methodology. I’m the Project Manager for the Open Source project Gallery, and run a small web hosting company that I started in 1999. I make things happen, from on time website launches to weekly after-work group runs. I’m usually early, always prepared, and positively impact everyone and everything around me.

## Experience

### Director of Internal Operations, Big Nerd Ranch 2012-2014

Highgroove merged with Big Nerd Ranch to form an 85 person company in late 2012. I acted as Chief Operations Officer for the first 3 months of the merger to accelerate coalescing of processes and cultures. Currently, I manage the team of developers that work on internal tools that enable us to run our business from custom software to IT, and work with the Leadership Team to figure out the direction these tools should take. We are up to ~120 people currently.

### Developer and Methodologist, Highgroove Studios 2010-2012

Hired with no Ruby on Rails experience as a Ruby on Rails developer, I quickly mastered the technology to build a bunch of great (and profitable) applications for our clients. As we grew from 5 towards 30 people, my role morphed into a ‘Methodologist’ where I helped other developers and our clients work together and effectively do Agile development. I taught several classes on Agile Development at both startups and Fortune 100 companies.

### NOC Manager and Operations Engineer, SugarCRM 2008-2010

My first full-time job out of graduate school, I worked remotely to lead the charge to take SugarCRM’s datacenter from a patchwork of hand configuration to an automated (with Puppet), monitored, and scalable infrastructure. Before I left SugarCRM, I was leading a team of 3 with an annual operating budget of ~$600k and a 24/7 production environment.

### Undergraduate and Graduate Research Assistant, Georgia Tech 2005-2007

While in school, I acted as the technical lead for CPR: the ‘Campus-Wide Network Performance Monitoring and Recovery System’. I wrote automation, monitoring, and data-collection software for 50+ monitoring systems around the world. The platform I built enabled researchers to run massive performance experiments, and I wrote several papers on network anomaly detection.

#### Platforms Engineering Intern, Google 2007 - Network performance simulation software

#### CTO, CollegeMedium 2006 - “Craigslist for college students” startup. Successful exit.

#### Security Engineer, The Fulcrum Group 2004-2006 - Software development and pen-testing

#### Linux Server Administrator, WebConnect 2004

#### IT Manager, Georgia Tech Student Center 2002-2004

#### Peer Leader/RA, Georgia Tech 2002-2003

## Education

### Georgia Institute Of Technology — MS CS 2007, BS CS 2005

I focused on Network Performance on the Computer Science side of things, and minored in Public Policy focusing on the intersections of Policy and Technology. The NSA gave me a Security certificate. I’m typically taking a class from “Open Yale Courses” at any time.
