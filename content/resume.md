# Resume

## Profile

Software Engineer turned manager, I deeply care about getting to the right technical outcomes, and the engineering and people machines that get us there. I have a track record of hiring, growing, and leading engineering organizations. I stay technical enough to add value in architecture discussions and individual changes.

I’m organized, systematic, and reliable.  I’m often the person that speaks up about something that isn’t right, and I’ve operated enough software stacks and worked within enough engineering organizations that I’m generally bringing solutions instead of problems. I am the person to organize a group run before work, play devils advocate to any point of view, and to geek out on super technical things.

I’ve had lots of fun taking 0-5 person engineering organizations to 25+, and while I’m comfortable across the whole stack, I’m particularly strong in platform/infrastructure work.
