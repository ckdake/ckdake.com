This past weekend, San and I took our first "real" vacation since our <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/europe-2008.html">Europe trip in 2008</a>.   Friday afternoon we drove down to Destin, FL to spend some time with some of San's extended family. Much food was eaten and many movies were seen. On a boat tour in Destin we got up close and personal with a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ckdake/14373071449/in/photolist-">blue crab</a> and a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ckdake/14373105778/in/photolist-">pufferfish</a>, and we saw <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ckdake/14559683795/in/photolist-obAbJX-nTFPV6">bottle nose dolphins</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ckdake/14373100369/in/photolist-nU6TZk-o9TTkL">stingrays</a> in the wild from the deck. 

Once Sunday afternoon rolled around,  we headed over to <a href="http://www.seasidefl.com/">Seaside</a> for a few relaxing days at the beach.  Our room was a tight squeeze on the 3rd floor of a tower with a great view:

We had a great time walking around, making <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ckdake/14373172568/in/photolist-nU7gs9-oa157y">pyramids</a> and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ckdake/14373166859">sphinxes</a> at the beach, riding beach cruisers around, playing in the ocean, swimming in the pool, and enjoying happy hour with a view of the ocean. 

I left my camera in the room for most of the trip so hopefully San will get all the photos she took posted, but I did take mine to the beach Tuesday evening and got some pretty awesome shots thanks to sunset, the moon, low tide, and a f/2.8 L lens. Here's a favorite:

Who wants to go in on a big house there at the end of the summer if it's not consumed by the oil spill?
