Last year was my first year of racing at the <a href="http://www.dicklanevelodrome.com/">Dick Lane Velodrome</a>.  It was a fun experience moving up from the Cs to the Bs that I <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2009/track-season-2009-report.html">wrote about last year</a>.  

This year my team (<a href="http://fastermustache.org/race">FM:Race</a>) was out in full force and we did really well!  Most of the team details are here:  "<a href="http://fastermustache.org/node/7105">FM:Race 2010 Track Season ends with a win!</a>". The short version of the team story is that we were the first place team out of 25, and Justin of FM:Race got 2nd place overall individual for the season.

I came in 10th place for the season racing in the Bs the entire time, a bump up from 25th last year with a combination of D, C, and B points.  Aside from showing up, I had two goals for track racing this year:

<h3>Do some team pursuit and madison racing</h3>

There weren't really any opportunities to do team pursuits, but I participated in almost all of the events this year. Usually, <a href="http://tir38.com/">Jason</a> was my partner but occasionally I raced with Justin.  The Madison is a crazy race, and a lot of fun. Us FMers were the slow ones, being the only Bs racing in a field of As (most of whom were Pros each time).  Here's Jason and I doing an exchange while <a href="http://www.teamtype1.org/teams/team_type1_men/joe_eldridge/">Joe Eldridge</a> comes around us on the outside:

Jason and I got better and better at exchanges as the year progressed, and the most we would get lapped in a 50 lap race was 3 laps.  If we both get faster next year, we might be able to snag some more points, and I'm looking forward to seeing what we can pull off.

<h3>Get points in a Pro Series event</h3>

This one turned out to be a lot easier expected, with me grabbing 3rd place in a 5 lap scratch race at "The Omnium" event early in the year and taking home a few dollars in winngins.  Then, at "The Madison" event later in the year I got a 4th place in a 5 lap scratch race and thought I was done, so I worked for Jason in the points race (getting lapped and pulling him off the front a few times) which helped him get 3rd place.  I kept racing in the other races to get some more time on the bike and, unexpectedly, I managed to win the Miss-n-out which got me 4th place overall and sent me home with $70!  12 total pro race points over the season definitely counts for getting points.

This year at the track was lots of fun.  40 race days, 50+ hours, and almost 800 miles.  All more than last year, and I continue to get faster.  I set a new personal record in the flying 200m tt at 12.79s, and set personal bests in a few other events. I also set a new personal best in goldsprints at the DLV end of season party with a 24.48s 500m, which on a track instead of rollers would be a world record (Especially at 48:16!). 

Will next year be faster? Will I move up to the As? Or will I remember that weekends should be spent mountain biking...
