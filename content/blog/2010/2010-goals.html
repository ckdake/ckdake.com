2009's goals were all pretty reasonable and it worked out pretty well, so I'll make things a little crazier for 2010 and see what happens!

<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Save over 20% of my post-tax income</li>
<li>Double ithought revenue</li>
<li>Pay off a big chunk of my mortgage so I can get rid of PMI and escrow requirements</li>
<li>Take a big vacation somewhere new</li>
<li>Make significant progress on programming my exercise tracking tool, and open it up to a public beta</li>
</ul>

<h2>Photography</h2>
<ul>
<li>No more 365, and no more flickr uploading. Use a "stream" album here for uploading from my phone and one-off photos:  <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2010/stream">ckdake.com/gallery/2010/stream</a></li>
<li>Submit a photo to a <a href="http://www.dpchallenge.com/">DPChallenge</a> challenge every week.  I bought a paid subscription today, so I have a few more challenge choices each week.</li>
<li>Print a few 8x10s or larger and frame them</li>
</ul>

<h2>Biking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do a few more century rides (hospitality, macc one love, tour de cure)</li>
<li>Mountain bike at 10 new places</li>
<li>Get points in a Pro Series event at the velodrome</li>
<li>Do some team pursuit and madison racing at the velodrome</li>
<li>4day+ trip of mountain biking in another state</li>
<li>Ride 150 miles in one day</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running</h2>
<ul>
<li>What? Running. yeah... 30 min of running in 35F weather beats 2 hours on a bike in 35F and supposedly has similar overall fitness benefits, and should help out biking a little bit</li>
<li>Get a sub-54 min qualifying time in a 10k before Peachtree Road Race registration</li>
<li>Run the Peachtree Road Race</li>
<li>Run the Atlanta Marathon</li>
</ul>

<h2>SugarCRM</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build a new app deployment system for dev/stage/test of our production web properties</li>
<li>Finish moving all system configuration into puppet (major things left to go: MySQL replication, automatic building application server groups using puppet stored configs)</li>
<li>Finish removing all legacy hardware, legacy VLANs, legacy IP space, and legacy routing policies</li>
<li>Implement password synchronization between dataenter LDAP and office AD systems</li>
<li>Build a new application server logging system using <a href="http://www.spread.org/">Spread</a></li>
<li>Build a Hadoop cluster and use it for generating real reports</li>
<li>Go to Velocity 2010 and SugarCon 2010</li>
</ul>
