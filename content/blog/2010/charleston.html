<a href="http://www.san-smith.com/">San</a>'s last day at work was last Friday (She's fulltime freelance illustrator now, let her know if you need something illustrated!),  President's day was a company holiday for me, and I owed my friend David a trip to Charleston because he is stationed there with the USAF and has stopped by Atlanta a few times,  so I put in for PTO for Tuesday and San and I took a long weekend and drove to the coast.

It was a pretty relaxing weekend of not doing a whole lot other than eating (starting with some midnight Taco Bell on Saturday shortly after we got there) and some light tourism.  San, Dave, and I spent a little bit of time exploring and taking photos on a couple of occasions; My friend Campbell from High School joined us for walking around downtown Charleston and a few meals and movies;  And Lindsey joined us to go to <a href="http://www.charleston.af.mil/">Joint Base Charleston</a> to see where David works and get a personal tour of a C-17.  

All the good photos from the weekend are <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2010/charleston/">here</a>, and here's a small selection:
