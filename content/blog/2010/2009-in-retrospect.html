I <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2009/out-with-2008-in-with-2009.html">did a small writeup</a> of 2008 last year, and set a few goals.  Looking back, 2009 was a pretty big year and my goals were pretty reasonable!  Here are some results:

<h2>In General</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ithought.org/">ithought</a> total revenue didn't double, but revenue from yearly hosting customers doubled which is currently the most important area for growth to me.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ithought.org/">ithought</a> got a little more legit by becoming a registered <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2009/starting-a-sole-proprietorship-in-atlanta.html">Sole Proprietorship</a> in Atlanta</li>
<li>Saved 22% of my post-tax income</li>
