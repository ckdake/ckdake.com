My last update here was in 2017, and since then a lot has happened.

<div class="embedimg"><img src="/img/blog/2022/IMG_0870.jpeg" /></div>

* mtb2k18 in Squamish and Whistler, BC
* Moved to New Canaan, Connecticuit in 2018 to manage software engineering teams at [Bridgewater Associates](https://www.bridgewater.com) for 2 years
* mtb2k19 in Sedona, AZ
* Added a 2019 Knolly Warden to the stable and rode a bunch of chunky rocky mountain bike trails and downhill parks all around New England, including attending NEMBAFest at the Kingdom Trails in East Burke, VT. Met a handful of great people, built some trails, and rode every wednesday night including when it was 17F out. 
* Family Vacation to London and Disney Paris
* Christmas with San's family in Getaria, Spain
* Went to AWS re:invent 2019
* A global pandemic began. Lots of Zwift.
* Moved back, temporarily to Newnan, GA, and permanently back to in-town Atlanta, GA to manage software engineering teams at [Zenput](https://www.zenput.com)
* Had a second kiddo.
* mtb2k21 in Crested Butte, CO
* Retired my 2016 Yeti ASR Enduro and added a 2021 Commencal Meta AM HT to the stable to replace it for XC and adventure riding, back to the Tuesday night ride in town.
* Lots of traveling and bike adventures
* Starting a new job on May 23. Stay tuned for details!

The theme here got a (minor) facelift today, and with a few weeks between jobs I'm much more caught up on 'projects' than I've been in a long time so this place may start to see a little bit more regular updates. I owe you some blog posts, stay tuned for:

* Mountain biking in Squamish/Whistler, Sedona, and Crested Butte
* What I learned building a dollhouse from scratch
* Mountain biking at [Paul's Mountain Place](https://paulsmountainplace.bike)
* What I learned building a sprinkler system controller with Homebridge and some electronics parts
* Reflections on Middle Management
* Any requests?
