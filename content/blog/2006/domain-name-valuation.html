I was cleaning up old mailing list email archives on my computer and stumbled across a discussion thread where someone offered a somewhat large offer of money to purchase <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a> from the development team. We thought it was worth a lot more than their offer, and so did <a href="http://leapfish.com/">LeapFish</a> - a domain name resource center.  They pegged our domain, <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">gallery.menalto.com</a> as being worth over 20 million. That's a lot of cash, but this is just an estimation tool. I ran some sites through and here's some fun numbers: <ul>
<li><a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">gallery.menalto.com</a> - <a href="http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=gallery.menalto.com">$23,024,196.00</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ckdake.com/">ckdake.com</a> - <a href="http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=ckdake.com">$29,900.00</a></li>
<li><a href="http://fastermustache.org/">fastermustache.org</a> - <a href="http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=fastermustache.org">$3,888.00</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ithought.org/">ithought.org</a> - <a href="http://leapfish.com/analyze.php?url=ithought.org">$2,772.00</a></li>

</ul>
Not that I'm taking offers for any of these just yet (unless you have something serious for #1.. :) ).
