Last weekend was crazy and great except for being sick. Regardless, the Faster Mustache 24 hour relay worked out and everyone had a blast. I put up a summary of the event <a href="http://fastermustache.org/fm24/2006">here</a> and got all of my pictures uploaded to the <a href="http://fastermustache.org/index.php?q=gallery&g2_itemId=16716">FM.24.06 Photo Album</a>. Due to my not feeling too hot I only did 3 laps, but they were all right around 38 minutes which was pretty above average (And fine with me for my first race on the track bike).   I think every single one of the 175 riders had an awesome time from paul who went to the hospital with a wrist injury after a run in with a car and ended up playing drums at the show that night, to JP who got his bike back that was stolen months ago. Next year should be even better!
