Mailscrubber is a tool that scans all incoming mail for spam and viruses and adds headers if it suspects
something you wouldn't want in your inbox. If Mailscrubber is 110% sure, it will throw away the email but
only you know what you really want to receive, but usually messages will be let through.  To acheive this,
most email that comes through is tagged with a "score" of how likely Mailccrubber things the message is spam.
If there is no tag, the message didn't meet any of the possible spam criteria Usually a 6 is a pretty good sign
that a message is spam and anything over 10 is almost certainly spam, but this may differ based on your
preferences and the kind of email that you receive.  So to see the messages that you want to, you must
set up rules in your email program to automatically move or delete messages over a certain score.
Additionally, Mailscrubber can learn from its mistakes.  When you receive a message that was identified as spam
but is something that you actually wanted to recieve you simply forward it to not_spam@mailscrubber.example.com
and Mailscrubber won't make the same mistake again. The same goes for spam messages that slip through,
just forward them to is_spam@mailscrubber.exaple.com and messages like it won't get through any more.

<a name="steps"><h2>Steps to follow</h2></a>
<div class="item">
To successfully work with Mailscrubber there are several steps that you need to follow:<br />
<ol>
<li>Configure your mail client to foward mail as inline text.<br />
        (see the appropriate section below for your mail client)</li>
<li>Forward all undetected spam one at a time to is_spam@mailscrubber.example.com<br />
        (just select the email in your client, click forward, type in the email address and click send!)</li>
<li>Forward all false positives one at a time to not_spam@mailscrubber.example.com<br />
        (just select the email in your client, click forward, type in the email address and click send!)</li>
<li>Configure your mail client to autosort incoming mail based on the scores that Mailscrubber gives them.<br />
        (Optional, but a good idea. see the appropriate section below for your mail client)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<a name="forwarding"><h2>Configuring forwarding to work with the learner</h2></a>
<div class="item">
Because of the way the learner works, your mail client must be set up to forward messages inline
instead of as attachments. Here are instructions for doing this for your mail client.
</div>
<a name="fw_moz"><h2>Mozilla Thunderbird</h2></a>
<div class="item">
<ol>
<li>Open Thunderbird and click on the "Tools" menu then click on "Options".
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_forward_1.jpg" alt="tbird forward 1" /></li>
<li>In the window that opens, click on "Composition" on the left and then in the first drop
down on the right, make sure that "Forward messages" is set to "Inline". Click OK and your settings
will be saved.
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_forward_2.jpg" alt="tbird forward 2" /></li>
</ol>
</div>
<a name="fw_apple"><h2>Apple Mail</h2></a>
<div class="item">
<ol>
<li>Open Mail, click on the "Mail" menu and then on "Preferences".
<br /><img src="/img/ms/apple_forward_1.jpg" alt="apple forward 1" /></li>
<li>In the window that opens, click on the "Composting" icon in the toolbar and towards the bottom of that
window, select "Include all of the original message" underneath "When quoting text in replies or forwards".
Close the window to save your settings, if it asks for confirmation, click on "Save Settings".
<br /><img src="/img/ms/apple_forward_2.jpg" alt="apple forward 2" /></li>
</ol>
</div>
<a name="fw_o"><h2>Outlook</h2></a>
<div class="item">
<ol>
<li>Open Outlook, click on the "Tools" menu and then click on "Options". (If you have smart menus turned on you
may need to click on the arrows at the bottom of the menu to see the menu item.)
<br /><img src="/img/ms/outlook_forward_1.jpg" alt="outlook forward 1" /></li>
<li>Click on the "Preferences" tab at the top left of the window that opened, and then click on the

<br /><img src="/img/ms/outlook_forward_2.jpg" alt="outlook forward 2" /></li>

</ol>

<a name="rules"><h2>Configuring rules to autosort mail</h2></a>
<div class="item">
Usually having two rules is a good idea. One to move for sure spam to the trash (score of 10 or higher) and
one to move possible spam to a spam folder (score of 6-10).  You can tweak these numbers later on as you
get a feel for what is being filtered.
</div>
<a name="rules_moz"><h2>Mozilla Thunderbird</h2></a>
<div class="item">
<ol>
<li>First, open Thunderbird and right click on your account name in the folders pane on the left.
Select new folder and when the prompt comes up, make a new folder called "Spam". Then repeat this
process and create a folder called "Possible Spam".
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_1.jpg" alt="tbird rules 1"/></li>
<li>Next is the actual rules creation. Click on the "Tools" menu and then on "Message filters".
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_2.jpg" alt="tbird rules 2"/></li>
<li>A rules management window will show up. Ensure that your email account is selected in the drop down menu.
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_3.jpg" alt="tbird rules 3" /></li>
<li>Click on the "New" button on the right and a new window will open. In this window click on the dropdown
on the left where it says "subject" and click on customize (the last item on the list).
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_4.jpg" alt="tbird rules 4" /></li>
<li>In the box that comes up, type "X-Spam-Status", then click the "Add" button, then click the "Ok" button.
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_5.jpg" alt="tbird rules 5" /></li>
<li>Then click on the "subject" dropdown again and this time click on "X-Spam-Status"
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_6.jpg" alt="tbird rules 6" /></li>
<li>Make sure that the next dropdown is set to "contains" and type in 10 *s into the box to the right of
"contains". In the bottom half of the screen, check "Move to folder:" if it isn't already checked, and in the
dropdown to the right of it navigate to your account name, then to "Spam" and click on it. Type "Spam" in the
"Filter Name" box, and then click "Ok"
and you're done with the first rule.
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_7.jpg" alt="tbird rules 7" /></li>
<li>Click on the "new" button on the right again and set this rule up the same as the previous rule but with
the name "Possible Spam" and with 6 *s instead of 10 and set to move to the folder "Possible Spam" instead
of "Spam".
<br /><img src="/img/ms/tbird_rules_8.jpg" alt="tbird rules 8" /></li>
<li>Your two new rules will be listed in the box and after you click ok, they will apply to all incoming mail
that has been tagged by Mailscrubber.
