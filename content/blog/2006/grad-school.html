So it looks like things are working out about how they should... I got accepted for a MS in Computer Science at Georgia Tech for next fall and I'm in the budget at OIT to keep doing research so I'll get a tuition waiver and they'll keep paying me.&nbsp; Emory sent me an acceptance letter today for a MS in CS over there and an offer for a fellowship thats a tuition waiver and a very nice wad of cash.&nbsp; My plan was for only one of them to accept me but we'll see what I decide. I'll probably stick around at tech and I've got to let them both know by the 15th of April.
