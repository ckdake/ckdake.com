This year for the holiday season, <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">Faster Mustache</a> is organizing the <a href="http://toys4tots.fastermustache.org/">Santa's Little Messenger Race</a>, a messenger-style bike race in downtown Atlanta. The race will work with the local <a href="http://www.atlantatoysfortots.com/">Atlanta Toys For Tots</a> program to get toys to those that need them. The idea of the race is that riders will pick up and deliver toys from our intown neighbors who may not have the time to deliver the toys themselves, or those just want to pitch in. The team with the most number of "toy miles" by the end of the event will win.

So if you live intown somewhere, please consider <a href="http://toys4tots.fastermustache.org/donate.html">donating a toy</a>. It's really easy!  Those of you that ride bikes should <a href="http://toys4tots.fastermustache.org/racers.html">sign up to race</a>.
