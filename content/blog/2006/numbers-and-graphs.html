Graphs are fun, especially when its stuff thats relevant to me and things that have happened over time. A long time ago I posted about the program I made to generate a <a href="http://ckdake.com/files/ckdake.png">graph of my AIM usage</a>. That graph recently passed 750,000 lines!  Another recent milestone was passing the 30,000 listened song number on my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/ckdake/">last.fm profile</a>. Thats a lot of lines and songs.

Another favorite graph of mine is the <a href="http://pudge.ithought.org/mrtg/">performance data for my server</a> graphed with <a href="http://oss.oetiker.ch/mrtg/">MRTG</a>. They work great when you configure them properly, but two mistakes have burned me a little bit.  Each time, I used a configuration script that someone else had written that had limits hardcoded into it. This lead to the mailserver throughput being limited to 25 messages until May of this year when I realized the problem, and the database throughput being limited to 2000 queries a second until late last month when I noticed.  After fixing the problems, the graphs changed substantially.  Emails approach 250 in a five minute period every now and then, and database queries approach 10,000 for 5 minutes. Because of the change to the db graphs, it now lines up much more accurately with the CPU usage and network traffic graphs. (The primary load on all 3 of those is the database driven dynamic content load of this site and <a href="http://fastermustache.org.">Faster Mustache</a>.)

The last graph of interest for today is the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/stats/?group_id=7130&ugn=gallery">project activity statistics for Gallery</a>. As the Gallery project manager, I try to stay aware of everything that is going on and the statistics that SourceForge provide are important metrics.  Browse around and check them out, they're pretty interesting, but I stumbled across one thing that makes a lot of sense afterwards but was a bit of a surprise:  Closing tracker items (bugs, tasks, feature requests, etc) that were recently created increases the average age for open tracker items. I was trying to get the average age down by closing things that were no longer relevant, but because the density of items is a fairly sharp peak of current items with a long tail, closing the same percentage of recently opened items and old items increases the average age. Ah well. I just need to get people to take care of all of the really old open things..
