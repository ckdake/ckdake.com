I finally got my third homework in Algorithm Design finished and turned in. The short of it is that I got to use a machine with 16GB of ram to try and find the shortest paths between any two points on roads in the United States ala directions on Google Maps. It's neat to have code that I wrote use up all of the resources on a machine that powerful for close to 45 minutes, and it was fun to write some C again. It's been a long time.
