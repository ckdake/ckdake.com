I never thought I'd see this from this particular crowd of companies but here's the basic timeframe for those of you that don't follow this. For years, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> has claimed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Software">Open Source Software</a> couldn't provide a workable business model. In August 2003, <a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a> (another large software company) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell#Linux_for_Business">began embracing Linux as a solution for it's customers</a>.  In November 2006, Novell entered into a <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell#Patent_Agreement_with_Microsoft>patent agreement</a> with Microsoft which led to people complaining that Novell had "sold out."  Microsoft says that Linux infringes on their patents, Novell said that they <a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/community_open_letter.html">didn't agree but still had a partnership with Microsoft working towards the same goals</a>.

And the kicker: Microsoft responded with a press release saying that they and Novell were <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/nov06/11-20Statement.mspx">_Agreeing to Disagree_</a> on an issue that many see as the core component of the initial agreement! It'll be interesting to see how this pans out.
