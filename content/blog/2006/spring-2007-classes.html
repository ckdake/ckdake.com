Registration for spring 2007 for me started today. I forgot that my time ticket was for 9am, but I still managed to get into everything I wanted to. Here's the list:
<ul>
<li>CS 6255 A - Network Management - Russ Clark - TR 1:30-3:00</li>
<li>CS 6262 A - Network Security - Wenke Lee - TR 3:00-4:30</li>
<li>CS 7260 A - Internet Architecture & Protocols - Nick Feamster - MW 3:00-4:30</li>
<li>CS 8001 NET - Network Seminar</li>
<li>CS 8902 F07 - Masters Project - Nick Feamster</li>
</ul>
8001 isn't in the system yet and I'm waiting on the permit for 8902 which might not happen until last minute if things are anything like last semester, but it looks like spring will be another busy but interesting semester.
