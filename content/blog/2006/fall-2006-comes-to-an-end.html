I made it through the semester somehow, and have to additional things to share from it. First of all, my term paper for "Technology, Regions, and Policy" on Distributed Innovation is now available on my school projects page.  (I also just uploaded a paper from last fall on software patents.).  My semester project for "Discrete Algorithms" which was also part of my research this semester is also now available on my FaultFinder research page.  This will eventually get updated as I work more on it, but it should be atleast a few weeks.

More to come next semester! (And I may get around to uploading some old school projects over winter break..)
