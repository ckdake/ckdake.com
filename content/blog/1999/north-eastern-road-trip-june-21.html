Today was our last day on the boat. I got up at 7:45 and went to breakfast. I ate my entire breakfast, French toast, and my mom's entire breakfast, scrambled eggs. While eating, my brother went into a very long explanation about Total Annihilation. My dad started to get mad but Michael did not realize it, and it ended with my dad yelling at my brother, which got him upset. Michael's main problem is that he has to explain every stupid little thing in the longest drawn out way that you could imagine, plus some more.

So after breakfast, eating both my meal and my mom's entire meal, I brushed my teeth and went up to Deck D, one of the observation decks. I pulled out the laptop and played TA for a while, alternating with my brother. I was hoping to get some work done, but this game was just much too addictive. Nevertheless, we had to eat, so I put up the computer and we went down to lunch. I had chicken, which was prepared almost the same as all of the other things that I had had to eat on this ship.

At lunch, they told us that we were going to have a fire drill at 3:30. That left us with three hours to play on the computer. My brother demanded a turn, and like everything else, he dragged it out forever, so I had to find other things to do. I talked to my dad for a while, and we got to the point of me working for his company. So I soon could be chief of Market Analysis, Technology, and Graphic Design for Kelly & Company, Inc. He would let me do this so that I could start a Roth IRA at the age of fifteen, and I would actually have some real spending money too. Since I was bored, I started work for a Kelly & Company Logo, which will be finish as soon as I get some graphics software for the computer.

As soon as I got back on the computer, the alarm rang and all of the fire doors slammed shut. I had to turn of the computer, pack it up, and then go up to Deck E. Everyone else, as I said, spoke French, so the instructions were given in French first, but they got around to us. We wondered why they would have a fire drill so close to the end of the trip, but it was probably just the time when the least number of passengers was on board.

After that, I packed up all of my and my dad's things on Deck D and went outside to watch the ship dock. Somehow, we were two hours early and we all thought that that was great, but it turned out not to be. Apparently, at the docks in Rimousky, the shipping companies have to use local union workers instead of the usual ship's crew, and the union workers only start work at 6:00. We waited for two hours, watching a huge coal ship dock and talking. We had dinner on the ship; mine being pizza and orange Jell-O.

My dad talked to the purser and first master so that the dockworkers would go for the cargo container with our car in it first. They did all they could, but at 6:00, it still took an hour and a half to get to it. However, we finally got in our van, packed things up almost right, and drove off. It took us a few minutes and a few questions to find our way out of the dock itself, but we finally did that too, and we drove south, for once, to our campground in Bic Park. The park turned out to be rather amazing, but the campground was just ok, and it was next to the highway. My brother set up the tent, and we did not need a fire so I did not have anything to do.

After everything was set up, we all got back in the car and drove around the park until the sun went down. Once again my brother did a poor job of setting up the tent, he did not roll the ground cloth, and he did not put in his retainers, but the first thing I have given up on helping him with, and the second thing, I do not really care. I went to sleep listening to Ben Folds Five and thinking about life.
