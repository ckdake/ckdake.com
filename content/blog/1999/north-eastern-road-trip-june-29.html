This morning I got up around 6:30, but I just sat in the car until about 7:15. Then I got up, packed up my things, and started to work on organizing the car. My parents and brother eventually got up, and we had pancakes and bacon for breakfast before we hit the road again. Not everything was completely dry, but we packed it up anyway, now with the icebox on its side so the water would not drip off it. We left the campground around 9:30 and drove southwest towards Harper's Ferry.
