It's that time of year again: In a few weeks, we at <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">Faster Mustache</a> are putting on our 4th annual 24 hour urban relay! Head on over to <a href="http://24.fastermustache.org/">24.fastermustache.org</a> to pre-register to guarantee your spot, as this is the cycling event of the year in the south east, and the only event of it's kind in the world. 

September 6th and 7th at Johnny's Pizza on North Highland. Take it easy on a 6 person team and just have a good time doing at least one lap a person (~10 miles or so), or go for the solo win which will take 300+ miles of riding!  Trust me, the prizes are worth it!
