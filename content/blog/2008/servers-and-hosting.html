I ordered a new server today to take over as a primary web hosting server so I can clean some things up on the other two boxes.  Initially I was going to use Dell but I had some issues with a recent order with them however they resolved those (more on that later) and when I was specing out things today, they had a great coupon:  Buy a $2800+ server and get $850 off.  Cool! My budget was $3k for this thing, and this deal enabled me to get faster CPUs for significantly less money. So Dell it is. (I'm a fan of having 1 phone number to resolve warranty issues with for 3 years at a reputable company, which Dell gives me. One of my servers is from Monarch Computer which went out of business 9 months after purchasing and it's having a problem with it's RAM or the motherboard :/)

A Dual QUad Core Intel Xeon E5410 2x6MB Cache at 2.33GHz with a 1333Mhz FSB  with 8GB of 667Mhz 2GB Dual Ranked DIMMs, a PERC 6i Serial-Attach SCSI PCIe RAID controller with 256MB Cache, 2 146GB 15K RPM Serial-Attach SCSI 3.5in drives, and mounting rails is on the way! (or will be soon atleast.)

When this shows up, all my websites will move onto it (~40 at last count), and the stuff I outlined in my last post can start to happen. Exciting!
