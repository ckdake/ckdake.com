I figured that starting off on a fixed gear or a full suspension mountain bike might not be the best thing for my still recovering collarbone, so I decided a few weeks ago that I was going to get a road bike. I researched around online and narrowed it down to a <a href="http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?spid=33106">2008 Roubaix Elite Compact</a>. All Shimano 105 except the brakes and cranks, about what my budget was, and I like the way it looks.  However, when I got to <a href="http://www.outback-bikes.com/">Outback Bikes</a> to buy one, they had some 2007 models left over... So I ended up picking up a 2007 version of the <a href="http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?spid=33104">Roubaix Comp Compact</a> for a few hundred dollars less than they were selling the Elite for. This one has Shimano 105 brakes and cranks, and slightly nicer wheels. Another great deal on a bike from Outback (I got my full-suspension mountain bike in a similar situation there a few years ago). I'm going to try a few laps around the block later today and hopefully the doctor on Monday will say that I'm good to start seriously riding outside again!  Hopefully those ~1000 miles I've done on the trainer will pay off...
