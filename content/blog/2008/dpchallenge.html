I've been participating at <a href="http://dpchallenge.com/">DP Challenge</a> off and on for a while now, but my images have rarely finished in the top 50% of challenges. (<a href="http://dpchallenge.com/profile.php?USER_ID=36620">here's my profile there</a>) Photography is a very subjective thing and the end result of everyones votes can be surprising! I was fairly confident with my entry into the Bicycles II challenge:

<a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/misc/dpchallenge/img_1849.jpg.html"><img src="http://ckdake.com/gallery2/gallery/51568-3/img_1849.jpg" alt=""></a>

but as voting went progressed, it swung around between 4.9 (more typical for me) to 6.8 (a possible first place!).  Could I win for once?  After the week of voting, I ended up in <a href="http://dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=677671">15th place</a> out of 135, which is in the top 10%! That works for me.  I like <a href="http://dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=678485">first place</a> and <a href="http://dpchallenge.com/image.php?IMAGE_ID=678230">tenth place</a> better than mine, but if it was up to me, I would have given myself third :)

Hopefully I'll start doing this more regularly, if only they'd offer and RSS feed of new challenges!
