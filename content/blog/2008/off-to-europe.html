Tomorrow afternoon, I'm off to Amsterdam for the 4th annual Gallery developers conference. <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2007/sept-gallerycon/">Last year in San Francisco</a> was pretty great, and though the crowd will be a little smaller in Amsterdam, we should have a pretty good time! After that, San and I head to Paris for close to a week of tourism there, including seeing the end of the last stage of the Tour de France.

If you need to get in touch with me for any reason, just send me and email and I promise I'll go through each and every one when I get back! If something is urgent, send me an email and then send a text message to my cell phone. I should be able to receive those there, and I'll get in front of a computer if I need to.
