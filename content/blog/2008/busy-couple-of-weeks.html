It's definitely been a busy couple of weeks.  We've had a few weekend events at work as we slowly are moving things to a setup that will prevent us from needing to do anything on weekends, and there's been a whole lot of bike riding. But first, my most recent tinkering with HDR photography:

Thats three exposures of one of the trees in my backyard, taken at 11mm on the new tripod with a remote shutter. On to what I've been up to the past few weeks that you might be interested in:
<ul>
<li>Tomorrow morning I'll hit 2000 miles of road riding this year, with 1750 of them on the <a href="http://ckdake.com/node/228">newest road bike</a>. That's bringing me pretty close to 4000 miles so far since February 1st, so hopefully I'll round off the year with 5000+?</li>
<li>I got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ckdake/2858329808/">new wheels on my track bike</a> and will be training on that this winter for next years season (assuming I don't break anything between now and then!). I've been mountain biking a couple of times and am getting back into the habit of 30mile+ mountain rides, and I'm slowly working out a training plan so that I can maybe win some races next year.</li>
<li>After 20 or so years of never having a real camera tripod and taking pictures, I finally purchased one. Here's a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ckdake/2889976901/">crummy picture</a> of the Acratech Ultimate ballhead with Leveler mounted on the Gitzo Explorer Basalt legs. It's sturdy, light, easy to use, and I'm looking forward to using it a lot. Hopefully it will last me another 20 years or so.</li>
<li>I was able to get a Wii Fit for list price! Daniel couldn't have said it better: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/ckdake/2888062683/">the internet rules</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://fastermustache.org/fm24/2008/">FM.24.08</a> happened again and was an even bigger success than last year. The tracking system worked great, but I unfortunately didn't take as many pictures as <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2007/fm2407/">at FM.24.07 last year</a>. <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/fm2408/">Here is this year's good set</a>.</li>
<li>The final Dick Lane Velodrome Festival of Speed of the year went down and I was able to take plenty of pictures there since almost nobody else from Faster Mustache showed up to spectate! <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/festivalofspeed3-friday/">Friday Night Sprint pics</a> and <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/festivalofspeed3-saturday/">pictures from Saturday</a>. After sprints on Friday, I rode around town and took some <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/nightatl/">awesome night shots</a> from the top of a building in downtown Atlanta, and before FoS started on Saturday San and I went by Connolly Nature Preserve and I got some shots of <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/connolly/">the champion trees there</a>. (<a href="http://treesatlanta.org/champion.html">Read more about the trees here</a>).</li>
<li>Lastly, I'm slowly whipping my mini-web hosting company into shape. If you're looking for hosting, head to <a href="http://ckdake.com/hosting">ckdake.com/hosting</a> and keep your eyes peeled on <a href="http://www.ithought.org/">www.ithought.org</a> for some exciting news sometime in the next month or so.</li>
