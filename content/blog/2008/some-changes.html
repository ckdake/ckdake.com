It's been pretty busy the last couple of weeks. A lot's gone on, so here's the short version and I'll likely go a bit more in depth over the next few weeks as I get around to starting to post more regularly.
<ul>
<li>I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Masters in Computer Science specializing in Networking.</li>
<li>I bought a house in Reynoldstown/Cabbagetown in Atlanta, GA and moved in. Still need to get some furniture and fix some things.</li>
<li>I started work as an Operations Engineer for <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a> where I'll be working on scalable infrastructure sorts of things.</li>
</ul>
