ckdake.com has been upgraded to <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0">Drupal 6</a>. However, a lot sadly remains broken. I'll get to fixing things over the next week but heres the list of what won't work:
<ul>
<li>Random quotes in the top right. (Quotes module doesn't work with 6.0 yet</li>
<li>Recently listened/shared/bookmarked on the left. (Aggregator module doesn't work with 6.0 yet</li>
<li>OpenID logging in. (The module won't install the table it needs, and it should because it's a highly publicized feature of Drupal 6)</li>
<li>Gallery blocks. (The settings page just ends up being a blank page, and the blocks won't work. However, navigating to personal -> pictures will still work and all the URLs to images should still work.)
</ul>
It's a little frustrating how much trouble this is, but that's what I get for wanting to upgrade to a .0 release and before checking the details of which modules are supported!

If you notice anything broken around here that isn't on that list, leave a comment here and I'll hopefully get to it quickly!
