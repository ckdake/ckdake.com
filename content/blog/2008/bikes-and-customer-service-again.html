It seems I'm not the only one thats notices that bike companies just seem to do a better job of customer service than anyone else that I've dealt with:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://alaskabikeblog.blogspot.com/2008/10/bike-people-are-better.html">Bike people are better</a> on Bicycles and Icicles</li>
<li><a href="http://www.san-smith.com/2008/09/new-bicycle-adventures.html">New bicycle adventures</a> on San's blog. She doesn't go into depth about how awesome Atlanta Cycling was to her, but they went above and beyond to get her the bike she wanted.</li>

</ul>
All of those stories are very representative of my experiences. Most recently, a screw fell out of one of my <a href="http://crankbrothers.com/">Crank Brothers</a> Quattro SL pedals. They're just decorative and don't affect the functionality of the pedals, but I sent them an email (during Interbike when everyone in the cycling world shouldn't be checking their email) and they quickly responded that they'd get a replacement out ASAP. A few days later, an envelope showed up with new screws and a few other parts for those pedals "just in case", as well as another card from "The Pedal Spa", a handful of stickers, and a note from "Drew" suggesting that I should put Blue Loctite on those screws to keep it from happening again. Awesome.
