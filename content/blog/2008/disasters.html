So for no real reason, I'm pretty interested in disasters: finding out details, figuring out what went wrong, etc.  I'm finishing up a great book: "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Normal-Accidents-Living-High-Risk-Technologies/dp/0691004129w">Normal Accidents</a>" that is highly recommended to anyone else interested in these sorts of things. (Though you should probably read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Spring">Silent Spring</a> first.)

As part of this interest, every now and then I'll spend a few hours poking around the Internet and Wikipedia to learn more.  If you're not aware of any of the huge human-caused catastrophes, here are some jumping off points on Wikipedia to get you started:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Environmental_disasters_in_the_United_States">Environmental disasters in the US</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Canal">Love Canal</a> in particular</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Medical_disasters">Medical Disasters</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_radiation_accidents">Civilian radiation accidents</a> (not involving fission, fissile matter or a reactor)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents">Civilian nuclear accidents</a> (involving fission, a reactor or fissile material from one)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_nuclear_accidents">Military nuclear accidents</a></li>
</ul>

So after spending who knows how many hours reading around, here are a few things I've found that are worth sharing:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Flats_Plant">The Rocky Flats Plant</a> just outside of Denver, CO was used for nuclear weapons production. As detailed in the Wikipedia article, it had a horrendous safety record and during it's operation, none of this was known to the public. See <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958003,00.html">this brief article in Time magazine</a> for an example.  The facility has been shut down, and it's pretty interesting to see the transformation in satellite photos. Check out <a href="http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&FORM=LMLTCP&cp=39.887733~-105.207481&style=h&lvl=13&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=26813962&phx=0&phy=0&phscl=1&encType=1">this map on maps.live.com</a> and zoom in and out, note what disappears!  The <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&ll=39.890805,-105.204263&spn=0.015147,0.024333&t=h&z=16">same map on maps.google.com</a> is a mix of older photography and newer ones, so only the left half of the plant is there. Note the highway that goes in a circle around Denver and how it's missing a section that would have gone through this area. According to wikipedia this work was completed in October 2005 and the site is on it's way to being a wildlife refuge. </li>
<li>While <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster">the Chernobyl disaster</a> was huge, most people don't know about all of the other awful nuclear/environmental things going on in the Soviet Union at the time. Disasters at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_Mayak_disaster">Mayak</a> between 1945 and the late 1960s have killed many and exposed over half a million people to dangerous amounts of radiation. You can see what remains of the biggest failed reactor <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=%2B55%C2%B0+42%27+44.75%22,+60%C2%B0+50%27+53.01%22&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr">here</a>, and from what I understand it's essentially just being left there because it's too expensive to clean up.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Karachay">Lake Karachay</a>, the lake they used _for dumping their nuclear waste into_ has been called "the most polluted spot on earth". You should take a look at it <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=%2B55%C2%B0+39%27+45.77%22,+60%C2%B0+51%27+17.58%22&ie=UTF8&ll=55.662143,60.855246&spn=0.044541,0.097332&t=h&z=14&iwloc=addr">here</a>: make sure to zoom out and pan around to get a sense of scale.</li>
<li>And then there are the bioweapons. Things like a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn2415">1971 smallpox outbreak</a> caused by Soviet aerosol weapons tests, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_Anthrax_leak">anthrax leak</a> in Sverdlovsk, Soviet Union in 1979, etc. These have all kinds of potential to go wrong and it's worth reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Biohazard-Chilling-Largest-Biological-World-Told/dp/0375502319">Biohazard by Ken Alibek</a> if you want to know more about these sorts of things. (Or atleast follow some links about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopreparat">Biopreparat</a>.) </li>
</ul>

I hope that was interesting, and I bet I'll post something like this every now and then. Let me know what you think!
