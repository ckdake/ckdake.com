I've finally gotten some things racked at a new datacenter and thought this might be a good time to launch the new <a href="http://www.ithought.org/">www.ithought.org</a>.  Everything that used to be at /hosting here has moved there, and theres a lot more new stuff!  If you have hosting with me and have questions, or want to refer anyone to me for hosting or consulting stuff, thats the place to send them!  If you have hosting with me and want to link to this site instead of ckdake.com, there are some images at the bottom of <a href="http://www.ithought.org/hosting/support.html">the new support page</a>.

More updates to come including a far superior status page.
