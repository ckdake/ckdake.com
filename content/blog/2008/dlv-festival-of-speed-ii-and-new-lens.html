I've been wanting a wide angle lens for a while, so I finally bought one so that I'll have it with me in Europe next week: the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&fcategoryid=148&modelid=10510">Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM</a>. Previously, the widest I had was 17mm, and those last 7mm make a huge difference. A friend of mine has this same lens, and after <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/wide/">using it in January</a>, I realized that a wide angle lens would make a lot more sense for me to buy than a super-telephoto lens. 

My first chance to use this lens was at the second <a href="http://www.dicklanevelodrome.com/">Dick Lane Velodrome</a> Festival of Speed of 2008. You can see all the <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/festivalofspeed2/">pictures of the Dick Lane Velodrome Festival of Speed here</a>. Most of them were with the 10-22mm lens, and it should be pretty obvious which ones aren't.  The edge distortion isn't too bad, and I really like the effect. I'll probably use this lens more than I initially planned on!

Given the amount of training time I lost at the track due to the broken collarbone, I probably won't be riding in the last FoS of this season, but I plan on keeping up doing ~200 miles a week throughout the year so hopefully next year I'll be taking less pictures and riding around in circles more! I did go mountain biking this morning for the first time since my wreck, and while it was only 1:10 of ride time on a familiar trail, it convinced me that I'm healed enough to start doing more serious mountain biking in places I haven't been. (And by the time I'm back from Europe it'll be 4 months since I broke it which is plenty of time to heal.)  Hopefully I'll be able to drag Ben out so we can get back in the habit of mountain biking every weekend and increasing the mileage each time.
