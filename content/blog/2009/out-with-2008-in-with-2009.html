2008 ended with me watching Georgia Tech get completely obliterated by LSU at the Chic-Fil-A Bowl, but at least I had the new mini-camera that San gave me for Christmas to take <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2008/chicfilabowl/">some pictures</a>. We made the best of it by joining the crowd in making paper airplanes and throwing them onto the field, and afterwards I met up with San at a party in Decatur to ring in the new year. Looking back over 2008, things were pretty good:

<li>133,083 visits to <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">fastermustache.org</a></li>
<li>I uploaded 2353 photos to <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/">my photo gallery</a></li>
<li>Saved/Invested 12% of my post-tax income</li>
<li>Doubled <a href="http://www.ithought.org/">ithought</a> revenue over 2007 and invested in new hardware that should keep my new hardware costs in 2009 pretty minimal</li>
<li>Finished 1 year working for <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a> and did a lot of really neat things. Much more neat things are planned for 2009!</li>
<li>First whole year living in the house I own.</li>
<li><a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/europe-2008.html">Second trip to Europe</a></li>
<li>Thanks to work travel, got Silver Medallion at Delta, and Silver VIP at Hilton.</li>
<li>Got organized (see <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/chandler-and-the-internets.html">this</a> for starts). Keeping up with things and what I need to do is now easy and doesn't get in the way</li> 
</ul>

2008 was also my first real "year of the bicycle". I've been riding bikes for a long time including bike commuting, mountain biking, etc, but this year was a big step:
<ul>
<li>Started to log rides using the ride log at singletracks.com. More details on equipment, mileage, etc, in a future post.</li>
<li>First (and hopefully last) <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/broken-collar-bone.html">broken collar bone</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/new-road-bike.html">First "real" road bike</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/covington-century.html">First Century ride</a></li>
<li>Another awesome FM24: <a href="http://fastermustache.org/fm24/2008/">fm.24.08</a></li>
</ul>

2009 is looking like it's going to be even better, and I have a list of things that I would like to see happen this year. I'd call them new years resolutions, but I'm on track to do all of these already and they're based on last year, so they are more like predictions than unrealistic goals! Heres the current list:

<ul>
<li>double <a href="http://www.ithought.org">ithought</a> revenue again</li>
<li>save 15% of my post-tax income</li>
<li>develop a RAW workflow for DSLR and stop shooting JPG</li>
<li>eat more protein and fiber, and less saturated fat</li>
<li>keep better track of nutrition/exercise/health (got a new scale and a blood pressure monitor for Christmas)</li>
<li>Race at the velodrome and in the mountains with <a href="http://fastermustache.org/race">FM:Race</a></li>
<li>Go on a week long mountain biking vacation</li>
<li>Mountain bike at 10 places I've never mountain biked at before</li>
<li>Ride 1000 more miles than 2008</li>
<li>Continue getting rid of things that I don't use.</li>
<li>Finish getting furniture for my house: bed, a few small tables, new filing cabinet</li>
<li>Do a few house projects like fixing some things in the back yard, re-doing lighting in the living room, installing closet shelving</li>
</ul>
