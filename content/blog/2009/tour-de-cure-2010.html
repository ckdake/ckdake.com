To add to my bike riding repertoire for 2010, I'll be riding in the American Diabetes Association <a href="http://tour.diabetes.org">Tour de Cure</a> in Atlanta in May to help raise money for Diabetes research.  I'll be riding 100 miles with some friends at <a href="http://www.lorencyoodesign.com/">Lorenc+Yoo Design</a> and we're hoping to raise $1000. Please consider <a href="http://main.diabetes.org/goto/ckdake">visiting my personal page to make a donation</a>.  Every bit helps, and this is a great way to contribute to a good cause. Donations are tax deductible, so getting one in before the end of this calendar year might not be a bad idea either!
