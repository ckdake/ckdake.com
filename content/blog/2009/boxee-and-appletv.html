I picked up an <a href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/">AppleTV</a> shortly after <a href="http://ckdake.com/content/2008/broken-collar-bone.html">breaking my collarbone</a> almost a year ago, and it definitely helped speed up recovery. I was able to watch media from my computer on the 42" TV, and once I was able to ride on the trainer, I downloaded the TV coverage of the 2007 Tour de France and watched them on the trainer.  Since then, it hasn't gotten a whole lot of use. San has rented a few movies, and we've gone through a few seasons of The Simpsons, Family Guy, Futurama, and Mythbusters.  

This all changed a few months ago when I got an invite to the <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a> private alpha. Initially a little rough around the edges, Boxee promised all media on the Internet would be piped into my TV.  The only problem is that I didn't really need to watch any media, so Boxee sat mostly unused on my AppleTV until a week or two ago. Even though we don't have cable, we get all the local stations broadcast in HD over the air so most things are covered: weather, FOX, CBS, PBS, NBC, etc.  (Discovery HD would be nice..) With what is available over the air, San has decided to take up watching <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/">NCIS</a> which is aired once a week but she missed one of the new episodes for some reason. While CBS has NCIS on their website, our couch is a lot more comfortable than the chair she has in front of her computer (and 42" is better for TV watching than 24"), so Boxee to the rescue! Pretty quickly, I updated to the newest version of Boxee, and was about to pull up the missing episode of NCIS in HD on the TV. 

It looks like Boxee has recently gone open-alpha (so anyone can sign up) and I've seen a lot of internet buzz about them in the past few weeks, so perhaps this is really about to take off.  Their first live stream via Boxee was of Obama's inauguration, though I stuck to my FOX HD over-the-air coverage. If you want to watch TV from across the room without paying out the nose, you should check out <a href="http://www.boxee.tv/">Boxee</a>. It works on AppleTV, Intel Mac OS X, 32-bit Linux, and Windows is coming soon!
