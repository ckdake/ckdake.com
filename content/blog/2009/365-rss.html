Some people I know started off this year doing "project 365" which has participants taking one photograph every day and sharing it with the world. One friend set up <a href="http://photo365.org/">photo365.org</a> for a handful of people doing this using Flickr. Some time on January 1st, I decided to participate and have been uploading my imaged to my <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/2009/365/">2009/365</a> album in my Gallery, and it's taken me 3 months to finally get around to writing the ~50 lines of PHP to make an RSS feed available for mine. So here it is, subscribe to <a href="http://ckdake.com/365.xml">ckdake.com/365.xml</a> in your browser and enjoy!

Now I just need to figure out what to take a photo of for today...
