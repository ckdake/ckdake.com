Well the semester is almost over. Senior design presentation was today andit went quite well. After meeting last night at the Taco Bell at 9 and continuing on to the CoC and staying there until 2:30 or so we finally got everything working and our demo was awesome.&nbsp; Everything worked almost as it was supposed to and that should end up being an A.<br/>
<br/>
Given the 4 hours of sleep last night, I came home and slept for a few hours and then headed off to get some Chinese food with Laura and a couple of other people.&nbsp; Got <a href="http://www.edamame.com/">edamame</a> which was the first time in a long time and it was awesome as usual, and then we went to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373926/">The Intrepreter</a>. It was pretty good and was sufficient to keep everyones attention the whole time. None of us are quite sure exactally what happened and who knew what in the movie, but thats ok.&nbsp; There was a preview for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421239/">Red Eye</a> and thats gonna be on the list of things to see when it comes out.<br/>
<br/>
But back to whats left... In a few short hours I will be running around with Melissa to look with places to live and then me and one of the other Chriss are going to get together and write our lab for internetwork security.&nbsp; Once we present that next week I have a take home short answer type final for Technology, Innovation, and Policy and then I'm done with the semester. My boss got married today so he is going to be out of town next wee so I won't be working, and my days will consist of figuring out this Europe trip and taking breaks for an hour or two each day to watch other groups big final presentations.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of planning for the summer I haven't heard back from <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> yet so I may not have gotten the student scholarship this go around in which case I won't be going to <a href="http://apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> but theres still a month or so I think.. If I do go I'll be there a few days early to hang out some with David in Los Angeles first.&nbsp; Also, the date has been set for the <a href="http://gallery.sf.net">Gallery 2</a> release party so on August 20th, the weekend before classes this fall start, there will be a good 30 of us or so partying it up in New York, New York which should be very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I finally gave in and go the new iPod I was talking about. Its a 60GB <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">iPod Photo</a> and is very cool.&nbsp; I also got the iPod camera connector (the only reason I had to get a new iPod) which was definitely a good investement. It downloads the pictures off of my camera faster than the laptop, and after all my music and other pictures got transfered to it there are still 18GB of space for more stuff. At about 2MB a picture off of my <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos10d/">EOS 10D</a>,&nbsp; thats a couple of pictures and should hold me over in Europe. More details on this and perhaps even a &quot;review&quot; once I get a chance to play with it more.<br/>
<br/>
I should start figuring out what to do for my 21st birthday in a couple of months..<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, its bedtime. More next week when all the time in the world exists.<br/>
