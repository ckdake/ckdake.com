First roommates dinner out was last night. We (Anya, Greg, Becca, and me) went to Micks (sp?) and I didn't get dream rolls. I don't know what came over me but whatever I had ended up being pretty good.&nbsp; Good times. <br/>
<br/>
So I was looking through my phone today and the 3 text messages I still have in my inbox are worth repeating:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>From: reflexids, Subject: Interceptor Alert: Incoming, Text:&nbsp; *NEW* 69.15.216.90:1654 --UDP--&gt; 10.3.18.25: 161 * Attack: 1 packets of type &lt;snmp public access&gt;</li>
    <li>From: Melissa, Text: there's this guy marching around the park in a tutu, twirling a baton, and blowing a whistle...</li>
    <li>From: Laura, Text: Hey. I just asked someone about radiators and they were like no good. Sadness.</li>
</ul>

Group projects really suck. I don't like waiting on other people to get things done that I need to do my work and I don't like the way tech students like to work which is not at all until the very last minute.&nbsp; Its Saturday afternoon and I feel like I'm stuck without anything to do because I'm waiting on people to get back to me and I have too much work to do to be sitting around not doing any of it.
