So I figured I might as well get going taking pictures of more things just for the sake of taking pictures.&nbsp; I remembred DPChallenge nd signed up.&nbsp; Here's <a href="http://dpchallenge.com/profile.php?USER_ID=36620">my profile</a> and my first submission will be up for voting tomorrow or the next day in the &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot; challenge.<br/>
<br/>
A quote from someones signature in the DPChallenge forums: <br/>
<br/>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">&quot;A friend is someone who will bail you out of jail, but your best friend is the one sitting next to you saying &quot;that was f***ing awesome&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
</span></div>
And the obligatory cool URLs of the day:<br/>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/ ">http://www.airtightinteractive.com/simpleviewer/ </a>- really cool image viewing flash app</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.band-central.net/atreyu/home.php?content=sqt">http://www.band-central.net/atreyu/home.php?content=sqt</a> - cd I want</li>
</ul>
<br/>
And the ckdake.com update of the day: You can now comment on these news entry thing. The format isn't great but once people start to actually use it (and once I have some free time) I'll make it a little cooler and have it remember who you are and all that.
