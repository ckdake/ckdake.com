&nbsp;Wow its been a crazy week with two more crazy weeks to come.&nbsp; Final presentation in innovation, technology, and policy on Thursday went very well. You can see the details at <a href="http://www.thegooley.com/files/pubp.asp?reset=true">http://www.thegooley.com/files/pubp.asp?reset=true</a> but basically we were supposed to have a quiz at the end of class but the professor was interested enough in what we were talking about that he cancelled it.&nbsp; Doesn't get much cooler than that.&nbsp; The presentation for information security on friday was pretty awful, but some people said that it wasn't as bad as I think it was. Either way that class is done with and hopefully a good grade will come out of it. Right after that it was off to the mountains with Mark to do some pyrotechnics for some boy scouts.&nbsp; We made quite the fire with an electronic propane ignition system that lit it with a small explosion that worked quite well. The 1000 or so boy scouts seemed to enjoy it and back to atlanta we drove.&nbsp; Per the usual pictures are available, the coolest ones being of the test ignition. <br/>

After that I spend a considerable portion of the weekend (almost all of it) working on senior design and the remote protocol is now fully functional. There is still some testing that needs to happen but success conditions work for every method. Oh yeah: new desktop background from some pictures at my parents house last week.<br/>

I love the new camera because the images are big enough to crop and split for a background that goes across both my monitors. Now I just need bigger monitors.. then a higher resolution camera... and it goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of toys, does anyone want to buy a slightly used Apple 30GB iPod?&nbsp; I got one a year or two ago and use it to listen to music in the car and need to get rid of it. I'm going to Europe for a few weeks and an iPod Photo makes more sense for holding images from my camera than taking the laptop.&nbsp; And I definitely don't need to iPods.&nbsp; So make me an offer and the old one could be yours. I'll be sad to see it go.<br/>

I registered for classes today and next semester (fall) is gonna be nice.&nbsp; 1 class M-T around 2pm for an hour or so, one class for a few hours Thursday evenings, and some undergrad research whenever I feel like fitting that in. In theory I'll still be working for The Fulcrum Group and we will just see how it all goes. Now I just need to find a place to live....
