I was just driving along and noticed the engine was running a bit hot so I pulled over and opened the hood and my radiator had just about finished exploding allll over the place. Awesomeness. After a lot of phone calling and crazyness its at the shop and 460$ later I will have a new radiator and can drive again. Hopefully all this will happen by noon tomorrow so I can go to Knoxville as planned, but so much for work and it looks like I get to bum a ride to class..  <br/>
