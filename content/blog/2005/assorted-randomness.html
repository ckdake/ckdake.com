Daylight savings time... Falling back I don't mind but someone needs to do something about this springing ahead business.<br/>

Finally recovered from whatever food wasn't getting along with me.&nbsp; Less homework got done today but had a group meeting for <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2005/cs4235b_spring/">CS4235</a> and took some really cool pictures waiting for everyone to show up espically <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/photography-new/IMG_5059">this one.</a> <br/>

My April Fool's day annoucement for Gallery got through to the <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/01/1621240&amp;tid=169">front page</a> of Slashdot which would be resume worthy on any other day but April Fools, and if all goes well I will get Gallery 1.5-RC3 (hopefully the final release candidate) out the door tomorrow<br/>
