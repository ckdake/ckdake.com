So it's been over a month since the last update.&nbsp; There's just too much going on, so this update is going to be short and brief and perhaps there will be more next time. So in no particular order:<br /><br />
<ul>
    <li>Competed in the Faster Mustache 24 Hour Urban Relay Race.&nbsp; Did 6 laps totaling about 70 miles over a 24 hour period in the streets of Atlanta. Combined mileage for all competitors in the race was 3200 miles. More info at <a href="http://24.fastermustache.org/">http://24.fastermustache.org/</a> and scattered around <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">http://fastermustache.org/</a>. I helped plan for the race a bit and was on one of two Faster Mustache teams.<br /></li>
    <li>Competed in 24 Hours of Adrenalin at Conyers.&nbsp; Did 4 laps totaling about 40 miles of biking on the mountain bike course from the Atlanta olympics.&nbsp; Race results for our category at <a href="http://www.24hoursofadrenalin.com/raceResults/156/5_Person_Co-ed.html">http://www.24hoursofadrenalin.com/raceResults/156/5_Person_Co-ed.html</a> (team Faster Mustache)</li>
    <li>So apparently I'm into the 24 hour biking &quot;Extreme Sport&quot; now. Cool. <br /></li>
    <li>the Faster Mustache website now has over 130 members and 5000 comments. I coded up a sweet maps module (<a href="http://fastermustache.org/map/destinations">http://fastermustache.org/map/destinations</a>) as well as a &quot;threads with unread&quot; bit of code to make it easier for people to find stuff.&nbsp; <br /></li>
    <li>Got a new mountain bike to race in above mentioned 24 hour mountain bike race, also switched from toe clips to clip in pedals.&nbsp; Its a 2005 Gary Fisher Cake 4 DLX. It's not on their site any more cause its 2006 now apparently but you can get the jist of it at <a href="http://www.jensonusa.com/store/product/BI603B08-Gary+Fisher+Cake+4+Dlx+Bike+05.aspx">http://www.jensonusa.com/store/product/BI603B08-Gary+Fisher+Cake+4+Dlx+Bike+05.aspx</a>. I paid a bit less than that because it was end of season and Outback Bikes was clearing out Fishers.<br /></li>
    <li>School continues to get closer to being done, the GRE is on wednesday, and I'm basically down to a big paper, the CS GRE, a piece of music for theory, and grad school application and recomendations. <br /></li>
    <li>Went to Tampa with Laura for fall break and had a good time hiding away from work and school.</li>
    <li>Upgraded the photo gallery on here to Gallery 2, <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery2/">http://ckdake.com/gallery2/</a>&nbsp; Old urls will continue to work but this should be awesomer than Gallery 1.</li>
    <li>The new gallery website is up at <a href="http://gallery.sf.net/">http://gallery.sf.net/</a> and its super sweet.</li>
    <li>I'm biking to campus every day and loving it</li>
    <li>I'm really tired from all the biking and I'm about to go to sleep. More later.</li>
</ul>
