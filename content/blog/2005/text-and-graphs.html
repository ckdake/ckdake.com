Lots of updates since the last one, here goes:

Everyone I know seems to have a blog, so now I feel all left out or something and I'm going to try and keep this thing a little bit more up to date.

I got a new camera! woohoo. Well, its used but in excellent shape. 	Canon 10D with a 24-85  3.5-4.5 lens. 

Now you can find out what I listen to all the time:  	<a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/ckdake/">http://www.audioscrobbler.com/user/ckdake/</a>.  	My apologies in advance for some of the awful awful music that may 	show up every now and then :). 

I got a new job. <a href="http://afulcrum.com">The Fulcrum Group</a>. If you need network security related things, give us a call. 	

Alternate view for printing, available under ckdake.com menu at the top. 

So I found this really neato thing called FCKEditor that lets me do text formatting with the input here. Click on the edit link for an example of what it looks like.

I also am starting on a perl script to analyze log files for instant messenger programs. My insane IM usage is shown here:<br/>
