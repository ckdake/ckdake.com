Apparently classes are up for fall semester and I've come up with the potential list. Once these are done with I'll be done at GT:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>PUBP 4410 - Science, Technology, and Policy</li>
    <li>CS 6255 - Network Management</li>
    <li>PUBP 4803 - Technology Law, Policy, and Management</li>
    <li>MUSI 2600 - Music Theory I</li>
</ul>
It should be a pretty interesting semester, and odd for me as a 5th year Computer Science major, but at 11 hours it should let me go out in style and hopefully keep pulling the GPA up. If you're thinking about taking one of those classes, well, you should. It'd be fun.&nbsp;
