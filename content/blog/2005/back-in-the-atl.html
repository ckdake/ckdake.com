I'm back in Atlanta and everything is crazy. My Airport Base Station is dead, as are my Klipsch 2.1 speakers, and theres just a lot going on to &quot;recover&quot; from Europe and get life back in gear here.&nbsp; The pictures should be up tomorrow, and there will be a big update on here with the full trip summary when I have some time, but I am alive and just working and catching up for the next 1.5 weeks until i head off to <a href="http://apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a>.<br/>
