It's been another crazy long amount of time since my last bit of ramblings here and a lot has gone on, so here goes another bulleted list:<br />
<ul>
    <li>New website. You're looking at it now. It's not a whole lot different but its better:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>the menus at the top are all CSS now and work in Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari, and Konqueror</li>
        <li>the menus are generated dynamically so it's super easy for me to move things around and not have to update lots of files.</li>
        <li>little slivers of color above titles so you know how you got to where you are.</li>
        <li>the title of the page in the title bar of your web browser now shows you where you are</li>
        <li>Random Image and Newest Album blocks on the left from the new Gallery 2 install which replaced the old Gallery 1<br /></li>
        <li>Coming soon calendar block on the left so people can see where I am at the moment without having to dig around.</li>
        <li>Better layout using CSS for everything. HTML tables should be few and far between. The site can now fill up a whole window without problems so there should be lots less scrolling out there for those of you with much bigger monitors than me.<br /></li>
        <li>Updated wantlist (get me stuff! its christmas time!)</li>
        <li>New documentation for how I run my server: watching the system for problems and dealing with lots of virtual hosts (Under projects-&gt;hosting at the top)</li>
        <li>coming soon</li>
        <ul>
            <li>better page navigation for news, portfolio, and things with lots of pieces</li>
            <li>updated bookmarks page which will be way better and maybe even useful</li>
            <li>old picture URLs from news will be fixed to work with Gallery 2 now that Gallery 1 is gone from here</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>New Server- This website and a bunch of others are running on my new server. Its a dual Amd Opteron 246 with 2GB of DDR ECC RAM and a 120GB SATA raid 1 array. &quot;pudge&quot; is sitting in a colo downtown with a 1MB/s pipe and doing a much better job than the old box.</li>
    <li>BIkes</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Faster mustache continues to explode.&nbsp; Lots of good times</li>
        <li>My old Gary Fisher Tasajara front suspension mountain bike is now a single speed no suspension commuter style bike with city tires. I've been riding it to campus and and all over the place. It's lots of fun and can take a bit more of a beating than the road bike. The ratio on it is 42:13 which is crazy hard but its good exercise.&nbsp; I'm going to have to ride the road or mountain bike again and see how much better shape it has me in.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>School</li>
    <ul>
        <li>After 4.5 years with 10 semesters taking some number of classes, I've graduated from Georgia Tech. My last semster was all As which puts my final GPA riiiight below a 3.0. Final projects for Science and Technology Policy and Music Theory both turned out pretty sweet and they'll be available on here sometime.<br /></li>
        <li>I'm hoping they let me into graduate school at GT but my GRE scores weren't anything special so we will see what happens a few months from now. The application is in and people are finishing up their recomendation letters.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Laura and I made it to 6 months during which time my brother and his g/f got engaged. Crazyness.</li>
    <li>Work</li>
    <ul>
        <li>I did my first bit of Windows development at work and finished a service that runs on Windows Server 2003 and allows other machines to request a password reset via .NET remoting.</li>
        <li>I did my first bit of Linux system development with a module for pam that enforces password complexity requirements. It works on Linux, Solaris, and AIX and is pretty sweet.</li>
        <li>They guys I do research for at GTRNOC are looking for money to pay me next semester and perhaps through grad school.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
Updates will be more often now that I have graduated and won't have any more official projects with deadlines to be working on at home.&nbsp; Gallery 2 is going to get a lot more attention from me now and hopefully the XML-RPC module will be born. But enough of this for now. Its Firday night, who wants to go ride bikes?
