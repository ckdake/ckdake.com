That was easy.  I don't have a whole lot I need to do this Fall and half of my classes are permits and don't require registering early or anything so it's 8:52am and since my 8:45am registration time began I've signed up for everything and have all the forms filled out that I need to.  Here's what it's looking like for this Fall:

<ul>
<li>CS6210 - Advanced Operating Systems with Karsten Schwan (MWF 2-3)</li>
<li>CS7270 - Network Applications and Services with Constantine Dovrolis (TR 3-4:30)</li>
<li>CS8001 - Network Seminar (time TBD)</li>
<li>CS8902 - Masters Project with Nick Feamster</li>
<li>CS8903 - Special Topics - Something on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multimedia_Subsystem">IMS</a> with Russ Clark</li>
</ul>
