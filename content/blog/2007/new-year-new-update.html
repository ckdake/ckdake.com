Nothing terribly newsworthy to report but a few things of note:
<ul>
<li>Christmas came and went. Highlights are the sheer quantity of photography books and a <a href="http://www.parktool.com/products/detail.asp?cat=23&item=PCS%2D10">Park Tool PCS-10</a>.  These knocked a few things off my <a href="http://ckdake.com/personal/wantlist">wantlist</a> (as did some amazon gift certificate things) but there's still lots on the list...</li>
<li>I guess you could say it's my Christmas present to myself, I got a pair of Seagate 750GB hard drives for the desktop. The 2x300 RAID array was full and this was the pretty obvious next step. They're installed and I've got a few hundred GB to spare for more picture taking.</li>
<li>I'm lucky to be alive. Last Friday night while biking from one place to another I had a run in with a pack of werewolves and a bear on ponce. I've got a bit of damage, the bike is mostly ok, and I'm an even stronger believer that helments save lives! There are <a href="http://fastermustache.org/gallery/randomness/wrecks/chwhathappened/">some pictures</a> if you want to see the details the day of. (The bruises hadn't shown up yet).</li>
<li>School and work crank back up full speed on Monday. I'm ready. Bring it!</li>
<li>And lastly, <a href="http://fastermustache.org/node/2680">it's on</a>. Corndogs and Videogames tomorrow night at my house.</li>
</ul>
