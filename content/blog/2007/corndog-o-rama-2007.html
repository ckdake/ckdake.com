That's right kids, <a href="http://www.corndogorama.com/">Corndog-o-rama 2007</a> is just around the corner!  July 12th - July 15th, _tons_ of great bands will perform, crazyness will go down, and many many corndogs will be eaten. All at Lenny's Bar (and the parking lots around it) in the heart of Atlanta.  (I've heard rumors of a new beach in the area..) It's likely I won't be there given the whole working in California thing this summer, but I did the website (with Kurt taking care of Photoshop) so you should check it out!  If you like eating or music, which if you're reading this I assume you do, this is a weekend you should mark on your calendar.
