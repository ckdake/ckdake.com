<a href="http://www.infion.com/">Infion.com</a> is now live!  From the site:  <blockquote>INFION builds energy systems solutions to cost-effectively provide Power for the Life of your Product. Much smaller than micro-fuel cells, our power supplies are combined with storage, generation, and charge control devices to meet specific power requirements for wireless network, consumer, and life-safety products.</blockquote>  My Dad is the CEO, and my friend <a href="http://kurtrampton.com/">Kurt</a> (then at <a href="http://www.propanedesign.com/">Propane Design</a>) and I put together a website for them. They make some really neat stuff!
