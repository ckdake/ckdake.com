It's week 2 of semester number who knows. It's a big number. Anyways, things are slowly settling in and here's what I'll be spending my next few months doing:

<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2007/cs4270_spring/">CS 4270 - Data Communications Lab</a> - Playing with routers and protocols and all that. It's a hands on lab class that will typically occupy most of my Wednesday evening but not require a whole lot outside of that. My lab partner is Terry Turner from <a href="http://www.oit.gatech.edu">OIT</a> which is pretty convenient as I'll be working on other things with him at work this semester.

<a href="http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Russell.Clark/Classes/07/6255-spring/">CS 6255 - Network Management</a> - What I do at work and have been doing research on, this time It's all a class focused around group projects. Russ Clark from OIT (<a href="http://www.rnoc.gatech.edu/">RNOC</a>) is teaching this one. I work with him in OIT pretty regularly and my project for class will be some overlap with work. If there are enough groups doing work related to <a href="http://ckdake.com/research/cpr">CPR</a> I may have a full plate helping them out, but if there aren't I may do a project on my own or with a partner. The current candidate is "Managing mesh networks with <a href="https://share-it.gatech.edu/oit/operations/gtswd-what-it-is-what-it-does">GTSWD</a> and <a href="http://www.cfengine.org/">CFengine</a>" because we're working to make the configuration management of CPR nodes a bit easier and GTSWD is just about ready for prime time.

<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2007/cs7260_spring/">CS7260 - Internetworking Architectures and Protocols</a> - More networking class! This time with Nick Feamster, who is also my graduate project adviser. This is another group project class and it looks like Chris Lewis and I will be working together again. We haven't decided on exactally what yet, but our <a href="http://ckdake.com/node/108">last project</a> was pretty awesome and we're thinking on building on it, somehow using libnetfilter_queue to grab packets from the kernel before they get to userspace and tinkering with them (encryption, compression, port changing, who knows). We'll see

I'll also be attending the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/computing/Networking/seminar/spring07.shtml">Computer Networking and Telecommunications Seminar</a>, attending the <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/computing/Networking/srg/">NTG Student Reading Group</a>, working on my research project, continuing to work at OIT in RNOC on CPR, doing some freelance top secret web application architecture consulting, and somehow find time for the rest of the now regular crazyness including Thursday night mountain biking, Friday night "midnight ride" etc. I also seem to have discovered my old habit of being more sociable than is probably good for me. Ah well, life is short!

For this summer, I've got an interview with Google sometime soon, maybe some others along the way, and I can certainly keep myself busy here at OIT and riding bikes if nothing else works out. Stay tuned...
