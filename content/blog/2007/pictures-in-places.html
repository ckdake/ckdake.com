My friend Robert e-mailed me asking for any camping pictures I had because the <a href="http://nique.net/">Technique</a> (the Georgia Tech newspaper) needed some.  I talked to him today and turns out they used one of my pictures so I'm now a "published photographer" or something. <a href="http://nique.net/issues/2007-06-29/focus/2">Check it out</a>!  (Gilbert, you're famous now)  There used to be a picture I took on chinesefood.about.com but that page has gotten a new editor and all new content along with it.

And <a href="http://ckdake.com/gallery/outside/2007-july-fireworks/">July 4th Fireworks Pictures</a> are uploaded. I really need to start taking a tripod to these sorts of things.
