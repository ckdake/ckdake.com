It's official, today I mailed off my acceptance to work at Google this summer. May 15th to August 10th I'll be doing work at Google thats likely pretty closely related to what I've been doing at Georgia Tech the past few years. It is disappointing to have to leave Atlanta for the summer but I'm pretty excited about it (and the pay isn't half bad either). I'll likely be living with a friend that's interning at Apple this summer, and will be spending a lot of time on a bike. Google's a fan of bike commuting, theres lots of mountain biking to be done, and my friend and I both took the track class a few weeks ago and there's a velodrome just a few miles away from where we'll likely be living. Now we'll have to see if Apple wants me at WWDC again and how Google would feel about some time off to go to that..
