Thanks everyone that came out to race or just to watch!  FM.24.07 saw 201 racers on 59 teams do 900 laps which is over 13,000 miles!  I didn't ride this year due to a slowly healing stress fracture in my leg, but this year I was responsible for the very cool lap tracking system:

If you're running a race and need a tracking system, get in touch with me and we can work something out! It worked very well for us.  

Look for the full race writeup on <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">fastermustache.org</a> soon, or just Google around for "FM.24.07".
