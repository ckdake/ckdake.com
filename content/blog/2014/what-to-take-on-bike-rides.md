I have a pretty usual weekly routine for doing things outside, and even though I've done some things over 100 times, I still find myself forgetting a detail or two every now and then. This post is a reminder for myself, and is also something I can give to people that I'm bringing along on a weekend mountain bike ride sometimes. If someone asks in the comments, I may even make a printable/laminateable template. I'll update this in the future as I'm sure I left out some things.

### Driving to Start

If I'm driving, everything above gets packed into a duffle-bag and I change before starting and at the end of the ride. Also in the bag is a towel, chamois cream, a full water bottle, and a snack for right after the ride.

### Epic

If we're going a 150 mile death ride, I'll add in more food, more cash,
