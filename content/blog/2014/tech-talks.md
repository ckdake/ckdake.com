I recently gave a Tech Talk at Big Nerd Ranch on "A Day in the Life of a HTTP Request." It takes as deep of a dive into networking and the internet as I can fit into an hour, and while it shouldn't be used as an authoritative reference on any specific detail, give it a watch if you're curious about the tubes. It's a repeat of a talk I gave last year that didn't get recorded properly. Below are the other recorded talks I've given in the past.
