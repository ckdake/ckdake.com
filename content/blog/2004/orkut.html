Well, I finally gave in and joined <a href="http://orkut.com">Orkut</a>. I was bored and it seemed like something to do, so if you have an Orkut account, I'm ckdake on there (suprise suprise).<br /><br />This website is slowly starting to look better and slowly starting to fill in. Its fun. Usually my website has kindof been something that I never really worked on and didn't care about (and it pretty much still is), but now its useful. Pictures, portfolio, the calendar will be up and running once I find a calendar program I like to use.  I never thought in 1999 when I first got ithought.org that this would ever turn out this way.
