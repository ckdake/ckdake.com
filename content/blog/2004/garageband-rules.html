The headline says it all.  Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/garageband/">GarageBand</a> software is jsut great.  It is super cheap and works super well.  here is a littl thing we put together right after we installed it that took less than an hour to do:  <a href="http://ckdake.com/files/ilife.mp3">iLife</a> That is Ben singing, me on bass, Frank on guitar, and the computer playing the drums.  We are working on redoing a song that I recorded a long time ago using a crummy mic and crummy software.  Sometime soon there should be a music section under projects on the left and the will be lots of coolness contained in it.<br /><br />
Anyways, we all now want to buy lots of audio hardware and even better software because GarageBand is just inspiring like that. And its amazing what a bunch of engineers and computer science majors can put together.  It's back to the music..
