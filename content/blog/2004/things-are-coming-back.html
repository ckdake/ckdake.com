Well, the news is now working and I am slowly figuring out how to do all the crazyness with mysql and php to have a certain number of things on a page and all that.  I think I have a better plan for running the other parts of my site too that should make everything easier for me atleast, and I'm going to start backing up this thing every now and then. heh.  <br /><br />Maxtor finally shipped a replacement for my hard drive that died so I guess that will go back in the server when it gets here.  Hopefully that won't break anything else this time.  <br /><br />Anyways, I am getting over being pretty sick and reading like crazy for all of my classes so I don't know when most things will be back, but if you check back every couple of days there should be something new each time.
