Well, I have my wantlist back up. Perhaps the most important part. Heh.  I bought one of the books that was on there, "Just for Fun" by Linus Torvalds, and I started it yesterday.  It's a freaking good book and well, I finished it today while the power was out.  I live in downtown Atlanta so I don't quite understand the power going out for an hour in the winter.. but whatver.  I'm starting on another book as soon as I figure out which one, and other than that I will be working on CS2340 homework until the end of time.  It's not that bad and I know what I am doing, but the squeak environment keeps crashing and our power keeps going out, and given that I am retarded and don't save all the time, things just disapear. Ah well. It's time for orchestra.  Maybe tonight I'll program this thing to tell you what day and time I type these news articles in.
