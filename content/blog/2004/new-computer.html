I ordered a new computer, Well, not so new really, but new to me.  It was 24$ on ebay with shipping and is going to replace the current router that I have. It should be something like this when I am done with it:<br />
<ul>
<li>sonic.ithought.org</li>
<li>Gentoo Linux</li>
<li>P1-133Mhz</li>
<li>64MB Ram</li>
<li>4 3Com 10/100 ethernet cards</li>
</ul>
<br />
I am moving into a new house ina couple of months and this computer will balance between a 6000/768 DSL connection and a 3500/128 Cable modem.  It will also be the firewall and router for my current machines as well as some additional computers.  Chances are pretty good that in a few weeks I will be on here whining about setting up iptables, but it should be fun.  Something new to learn with Linux.<br /><br />
[edit]couldnt get DSL. blah. just cable. no good[/edit]
<br /><br />
In other news I have been slowly taking more test and getting more tests back and I am doing okay on them.  Could be better, could be worse.  My 3 major group projects are also slowly progresing and the first georgia tech orchestra concert is tonight.
