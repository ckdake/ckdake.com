It's been a little while but not too much is going on.  David's <a href="http://david.ithought.org">website</a> and Frank's <a href="http://everett.ithought.org">website</a> are finally showing some signs of coolness.<br /><br />In other news I have now had a test in all of my classes and they all went pretty much alright.  (I just found a really cool website: <a href="http://www.kartoo.com">http://www.kartoo.com</a>) Anyways, I am working on getting my bookmarks up on here so I can get at them from everywhere and so people can get an idea of what I am interested in. I gotta figure out something a little more interesting to do after that but right now it is time for Probability and Statistics so more later...
