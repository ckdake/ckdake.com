<h2>The Plan</h2>

<ul>
  <li>MWF: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine">r/bodyweightfitness recommended routine</a> first thing in the morning at work</li>
  <li>Working on figuring out: Weekly evening ride, weekend ride routine</li>
</ul>

I ride mountain bikes for fun, and ride most other kinds of bikes to make mountain biking more fun.  In 2004 I co-founded <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">Faster Mustache</a> which at one point was the place to go for anything bike related in Atlanta. We organized the only urban 24 hour race in the world for 5 years in a row, and spun up a pretty solid race team: <a href="http://fastermustache.org/race">FM:Race</a>. In 2009 I raced full seasons of XC mountain bike racing and velodrome racing.  2010 I focused on track racing and as team leader, led us to a 1st place team finish for the season with 4 people in the top 15 individual standings including first place.  In 2011 I raced a full season at the track, but focused on the Chainbusters 6-hour race series where  Jason and I  took 3th of over 75 teams in the Pro/Open Men's Duo category.  Some cyclocross races were ridden, and 2012 was a the year of running races and mountain biking adventures. 2013 onward bring bigger bike adventures, and running with a bigger crowd. In 2014 I ran a half marathon every month, and 2015 onward is back to just making sure I'm mountain biking as much as possible and taking as many new people riding as possible. A move to CT in early 2018 means lots of new singletrack to find!
