<h2>Chris's List</h2>
<p>Similar to those online places that recommend companies you should use, here is mine. None of this feedback is paid or solicited or rewarded unless specifically indicated. I like and highly recommend all of these things.</p>

<h3>Internet Stuff</h3>
<p>These links are all referral links. I'll get some $ if you sign up and pay them, but I'd recommend them even without referral programs</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wlth.fr/1119Pfi">Wealthfront</a> is the place to invest your money when you don't want to worry about stock/fund picking. I have my ROTH IRA and Rollover IRA there and have been very happy with the process and the returns.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=62435">NameCheap</a> - I have over 50 domains registered at NameCheap. Their purchase process is quick and painless.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f7ac2e018837">Digital Ocean</a> - I use Digtal Ocean for my 'cloud hosting' when I don't want something running on the hardware in my datacenter.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ubiquityhosting.com/aff/index/2429">Ubiquity Hosting</a> - I use Ubiquity for my datacenter colocation. They have cloud products as well. Use this link to get a $10 credit on service there</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://tracking.rackspace.com/SHrj">Rackspace</a> is the place to go for hosted e-mail. My e-mail lives there, as does many of my hosting customers.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ithought.freshbooks.com/refer/www">FreshBooks</a> is fantastic accounting software that doesn't make mistakes and makes it easy to keep my company books.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Contractors/etc</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Roofing: David at <a href="http://firstratesiding.com/">First Rate Siding</a> was pleasant to work with. He communicated with me via e-mail and SMS as appropriate, and worked with his team to get my roof replaced in a timely and cost-effective manner in April 2015. </li>
  <li>Financial Advisor: Kyle at <a href="http://kylebrooker.nm.com/">Northwestern Mutual</a> has been a great help at guiding me through the mess of insurance options, and with support from his team he's helped me out with planning my saving and eventual retirement.</li>
  <li>Handyman: Donald at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fixosis">Fixosis</a> is the man. If it is in any way related to your house, he can fix it.</li>
  <li>Lawn Care: Jose at C & L Landscaping, LLC takes great care of my grass and everything else in my yard, doing the right things at the right time throughout the year, and he's a great deal. ramosrjose@yahoo.com / 678-733-7648</li>
  <li>Electric work: Jeff at Jeff Electric is a one-man show and does good work at a good price. I had him work on my old house to prepare it to sell, and my new house to get everything grounded/GCFI protected and install a few more outlets.  jeffelectric1@yahoo.com / 404-775-4897</li>
</ul>
