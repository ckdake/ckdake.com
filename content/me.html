<h2 style="clear:both; padding-top: 10px;">Instigator and Problem Solver</h2>
<p>ckdake is me. This name came about because it was the first screenname I came up with that I could get on AOL in the late 90s that didn't have numbers in it, and it's stayed unique over the years. If you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ckdake">google for it</a>, everything that shows up is pretty much guaranteed to be me.</p>

<p>Working at <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> pays my bills. If you're looking for a custom mobile device application or web application, get in touch! chris@bignerdranch.com</p>

<p>I ride bikes (and run sometimes). If you do this too (which you should), join me for a ride (or a run) sometime: <a href="/bikes.html">The Details</a>.</p>

<p>I take photos to capture my experiences: <a href="/gallery">See Them</a>. Occasionally they get published.</p>

<p>I've done my share of projects, some are ongoing. Hover over 'projects' on the left for the list.</p>

<p>I'm an <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/INTJ.html">INTJ</a>, but only slightly I.   I'm a high C in my DISC profile, and an even higher C in adaptive mode. People that know me well know that they can count on me to be on time (or early), have the master plan (if nobody else does), and solve hard problems in the best way possible with everyones interests in mind. People that don't know me sometimes think I'm impersonal, quick to jump to conclusions, or boring. I take a deliberate approach to everything I do, and seek out problems to solve.</p>

<h2>A Brief History</h2>

<p>I finished grad school at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a> in 2007 where I spent a lot of time doing computer science related research in <a href="http://www.rnoc.gatech.edu/">RNOC</a> (mostly around <a href="http://www.rnoc.gatech.edu/cpr/">CPR</a>). I'm the project manager for <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/">Gallery</a>, and I'm the webmaster and a race team member over at <a href="http://fastermustache.org/">Faster Mustache</a>. In the Summer of 2007 I was an intern at <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, from January 2008 until July 2012 I worked in Operations <a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/">SugarCRM</a> ending up as the Operations Manager.  In August 2011 I started at <a href="http://highgroove.com/">Highgroove Studios</a> as a Software Developer and morphed into the Methodologist. In November 2012, we merged with <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/">Big Nerd Ranch</a> where I'm currently working to help make things great.</p>

<h2 style="clear: both;">Music</h2>
Sometimes I make music, and frequently I listen to music. I play cello, bass guitar, a bit of piano, and a little guitar guitar and you can hear some things I've made on my <a href="/personal/media.html">media projects</a> page.  I'll listen to any music that has soul and some that doesn't, but if I had to pick some keywords for what I really like it would be something like post-hardcore melodic screamo with a good bit of 90s rock thrown in for good measure.  <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/ckdake">My Last.fm page</a> has all the details of what I listen to but heres some trivialities:<br />
